# RGBdle

It's Wordle, but for colors! Specifically, for RGB values.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About
I made this as an exercise for myself to cement some knowledge about React and Material UI, as well as to try out hosting a React app on AWS Amplify. 
It's just a fun little game based on Wordle's style, where users have 6 attempts to guess an RGB value. There's hints along the way.
